# Yet another Minecraft client

This project aspires to be a
[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) client written in
[zig](https://ziglang.org) using WebGPU as the 3D renderer.

It currently only works on macOS.

To get started, run `./setup.bash` to download and build `wgpu-native`,
which is an implementation of the WebGPU specification written in Rust
and exposing a C API.
